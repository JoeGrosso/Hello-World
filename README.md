# Hello-World
This new technology is the latest in greeting the world with the familiar yet not-yet-cliche saying "hello". 
I am a 34 year old dude who wants to learn programming.  Just intalled my linux and am using it for the first time ever.  I am very interested in computer science, from all the way down to the transistor and logic gate level (which blows my mind by the way... Boolean alegbra??? Like hellO? It's so damn fascinating...also hard to understand cause i'm not a genius).  

Anyway this program is not going to be anythng cool... but someday.. ohhh someday my friends, mark my words, I will create a whole program that will take over the world!  Bwah ha ha ha ha!! <=====(picture evil laugh type voice...ya know... villan-esk)
